# Predicting Music Artists' Concert Sales Using YouTube and Spotify Data

Our group aims at analyzing and predicting music artists' 
concert sales by using data from different sources like 
YouTube and Spotify. We believe that YouTube statistics 
on the music videos of artists’ featured songs in their albums, 
such as the number of views, likes and dislikes, would be 
helpful in predicting corresponding concerts’ monetary success. 
Moreover, we will use text mining on the YouTube videos' 
comments to analyze the public opinions and responses to 
the music videos through taking the top 50 comments for 
each music video. In addition to YouTube data, we also 
collect data from Spotify to understand more about the 
songs' features and popularity to assess how these song 
metrics translate into sales revenue. The different data 
sets will be merged into a final data set prepared for a 
regression analysis to predict concert sales. We then use 
this data set to build regression models to predict 
artists' future concert ticket sales. With this analysis, 
we hope to help artists and entertainment companies make 
informed decisions on allocating resources efficiently into 
making their videos on YouTube and distributing their songs 
on Spotify so that they can maximize their concert sales.
